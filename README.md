# Artificial Intelligence 🚀

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository is my personal journey of **learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) from scratch**.  
Here, I will be documenting everything I study, practice, and build — from the very basics of algorithms to advanced AI concepts.

The goal is simple:
- Learn AI step by step
- Implement concepts with clean, understandable code
- Create a resource I (and others) can revisit anytime
